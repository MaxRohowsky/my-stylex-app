This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The project has been adjusted slightly to work with Facebook's StyleX (https://stylexjs.com/)

## Getting Started

To get started, please install the following modules:

`npm install --save @stylexjs/stylex`

`npm install --save @stylexjs/babel-plugin`

`npm install --save @stylexjs/nextjs-plugin`

`npm install --save @babel/runtime`

Afterwards you can run the project by running "npm run dev"
